## Hi there 👋

I'm Thomas van Dongen. I am currently working as head of AI engineering at [Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/gp). I am one of the founding members (and current maintainer) of [Minish](https://github.com/MinishLab), developing open-source machine learning packages.



## I'm currently working on:
- [model2vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec): a library for creating state-of-the-art static embedding models by distilling sentence transformers.
- [semhash](https://github.com/MinishLab/semhash): a library for lightweight text deduplication, outlier detection, and representative filtering.
- [vicinity](https://github.com/MinishLab/vicinity): a library for fast and lightweight nearest neighbor search, with flexible indexing backends.
- [tokenlearn](https://github.com/MinishLab/tokenlearn): a library for pre-training static embedding models.
- [model2vec-rs](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec-rs): a Rust port of Model2Vec.
- [pyversity](https://github.com/Pringled/pyversity): a library for retrieval result diversification.

## My research interests include:
- **Small, fast models**: I like making eco-friendly models that do not need expensive hardware.
- **Word embeddings**: Specifically focusing on static word embeddings (yes, I believe they are still relevant!)
- **Information retrieval and recommenders**: In my day-to-day job I focus on developing recommenders and information retrieval pipelines for the scientific domain.
