## Hi there 👋

I'm Thomas van Dongen. I am currently working as head of AI engineering at [Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/gp). I am one of the founding members of [The Minish Lab](https://github.com/MinishLab) where we develop open-source machine learning packages.

My research interests include:
- 🚤 **Small, fast models**: Making CPU-friendly models that can run on any device.
- 🧩 **Word Embeddings**: Focusing on static embeddings to balance performance and resource usage.
- ⚡ **Efficient Nearest Neighbors**: Optimizing ANN/KNN methods for scalable semantic search.
- 🔍 **Recommenders**: Developing smarter systems to improve recommendations and information retrieval, focussed on the scientific publishing space.


I'm currently working on:
- [model2vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec): a library for creating state-of-the-art static embedding models by distilling sentence transformers.
- [vicinity](https://github.com/MinishLab/vicinity): a library for fast and lightweight nearest neighbor search, with flexible indexing backends.
- [semhash](https://github.com/MinishLab/semhash): a library for lightweight text deduplication, outlier detection, and representative filtering.
- [tokenlearn](https://github.com/MinishLab/tokenlearn): a library for pre-training static embedding models.
- [model2vec-rs](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec-rs): a Rust port of Model2Vec.
